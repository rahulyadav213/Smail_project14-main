This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning project that includes both model training and inference testing. It is designed to be simple to use, fully implemented in Jupyter Notebooks, and organized into clearly defined folders for different stages of the ML pipeline.

📁 Folder Structure
1. Training_folder
This folder includes all the necessary scripts, configurations, and datasets required to train the machine learning model.

Model training notebooks

Preprocessing scripts

Configuration files

Training datasets

2. Infra_folder
After training the model, the Infra_folder is used to validate the model’s performance through inference.

Inference notebooks

Scripts to run model on videos

Sample video input and inference output

✨ Key Features
Training: Build and train your machine learning model using provided data and configurations.

Inference: Run the trained model on video inputs to test its real-world performance.

User-Friendly Interface: Fully implemented using Jupyter Notebooks to facilitate ease of experimentation and understanding.

✅ Requirements
Ensure the following are installed on your machine:

Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

Required Python libraries (specified in requirements.txt or listed in the notebooks)

🚀 How to Use
🔧 Train the Model
Navigate to the Training_folder.

Open the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) inside.

Follow the step-by-step instructions to:

Load the dataset

Preprocess the data

Train the machine learning model

Save the trained model

🧪 Test the Model (Inference)
After training, go to the Infra_folder.

Open the provided Jupyter Notebook for inference.

Follow the instructions to:

Load the trained model

Perform inference on video data

Evaluate performance


📌 Notes
Please make sure to download the datasets and place them in the correct folder as specified in the notebooks.

All paths in the notebooks are relative and can be updated based on your local setup.
